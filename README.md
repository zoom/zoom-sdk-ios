## Obtaining SDK packages from Marketplace

We are pleased to inform you that starting from v5.4.54520.1229, the Zoom SDK packages are moving to the Zoom App Marketplace. The packages are now available in the same location as your SDK Key & Secret. This change aims to provide you with a unified and seamless experience so that you can access the required SDK resources in one place. 

If you have not used Zoom SDK before, please follow the steps in https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/build/sdk-app to create an SDK app on the Marketplace.

If you already have an SDK app created, login to the **[Zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/)** using your developer account, click the **Manage** button on the top-right corner and locate your SDK app.

## What is Zoom iOS SDK?

Zoom SDK makes it easy to integrate Zoom with your iOS applications, and boosts up your applications with the power of Zoom.

* **Easy to use**: Our SDK is built to be easy to use. Just import the libraries, call a few functions, and the Zoom video service is now added to your application.
* **Localizable**: Our SDK naturally supports [multiple major languages](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/209982306-Change-your-language-on-Zoom), and you can add more to grow your applications internationally.
* **Customizable Meeting UI**: If you want to add your own decorations to your Zoom meeting rooms, try our Custom UI feature to make your meeting UI special.
